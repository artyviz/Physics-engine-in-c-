# Physics Engine

A real-time physics engine implemented in C++ using SFML for visualization.

## Overview

This project aims to provide a simple yet extensible physics engine capable of simulating various physical phenomena, including particles, constraints, and forces. The engine uses Verlet integration for smooth and stable simulations.

## Features

- Real-time physics simulation with Verlet integration
- Support for particles and constraints
- Gravity and damping effects
- User interaction to manipulate the simulation
- Highlighting and tearing constraints
- Fixed timestep for stable simulation
- Modular design with Particle, Constraints, and Renderer classes

## Requirements

- C++17 or later
- SFML 3.x (not backwards compatible with SFML 2.x)
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/physics-engine.git
   cd physics-engine
   ```

2. **Install SFML:**
   - **Linux:**
     ```sh
     sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
     ```
   - **Windows:**
     - Download and install SFML from [SFML's official website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php).
     - Ensure the SFML binaries are in your system's PATH.
   - **macOS:**
     ```sh
     brew install sfml
     ```

3. **Build the project:**
   - **Using CMake:**
     ```sh
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake ..
     make
     ./phyeng
     ```

## Usage

- **Run the simulation:**
  ```sh
  ./phyeng
  ```

- **Interact with the simulation:**
  - **Left Mouse Button:** Click on a constraint to tear it.
  - **Mouse Hover:** Highlight constraints to see which one will be torn.
